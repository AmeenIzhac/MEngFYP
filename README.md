### Domain Specific Knowledge For Large Language Models

# Brief

This is the code repository for the Imperial MEng Computing Individual Project on the above title subject. The project aim is to develop, and learn about the methods for creating a language model that is designed for answering questions about a specific domain, specifically focusing on the knowledge aspect. The Anatomy domain is used as case study.
